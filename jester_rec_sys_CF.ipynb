The attendant runs out of the station to serve them when Hillary realizes it's an old boyfriend from high school. She and the attendant chat as he gases up their car and cleans the windows. Then they all say good-bye.  As Bill pulls the car onto the road, he turns to Hillary and says, 'Now aren't you glad you married me and not him ? You could've been the wife of a grease monkey !'  To which Hillary replied, 'No, Bill. If I would have married him, you'd be pumping gas and he would be the President !'   \\\n",

       "              Bill & Hillary are on a trip back to Arkansas. They're almost out of gas, so Bill pulls into a service station on the outskirts of town. The attendant runs out of the station to serve them when Hillary realizes it's an old boyfriend from high school. She and the attendant chat as he gases up their car and cleans the windows. Then they all say good-bye.  As Bill pulls the car onto the road, he turns to Hillary and says, 'Now aren't you glad you married me and not him ? You could've been the wife of a grease monkey !'  To which Hillary replied, 'No, Bill. If I would have married him, you'd be pumping gas and he would be the President !'   \\\n",

This gives us a correlation score between every pair of jokes (I take into consideration that at least one user rated both jokes - otherwise NaN's would show up). Here I could also standardize the NaN scores and use the cosine_similarity method to calculate similarities between the jokes. However I prefered to use the pandas method because of it's simplicity."

After he is finished eating, he pulls out a gun and rips the place with gunfire.  Patrons scatter and dive under chairs and tables as the bear runs out the door.  After ensuring that no one is hurt,  the bartender races out the door, and calls after the bear \"What the hell did you do that for?\"  The bear calls back, \"I'm a Panda bear.  Look it up in the dictionary.\"   The bartender returns, pulls out his dictionary. panda : \\Pan\"da\\, n. (Zo[\"o]l.) A small Asiatic mammal (Ailurus fulgens) having fine soft fur. It is related to the bears, and inhabits the mountains of Northern India. Eats shoots and leaves.  \\\n",

The attendant runs out of the station to serve them when Hillary realizes it's an old boyfriend from high school. She and the attendant chat as he gases up their car and cleans the windows. Then they all say good-bye.  As Bill pulls the car onto the road, he turns to Hillary and says, 'Now aren't you glad you married me and not him ? You could've been the wife of a grease monkey !'  To which Hillary replied, 'No, Bill. If I would have married him, you'd be pumping gas and he would be the President !'   \\\n",

       "   Bill & Hillary are on a trip back to Arkansas. They're almost out of gas, so Bill pulls into a service station on the outskirts of town. The attendant runs out of the station to serve them when Hillary realizes it's an old boyfriend from high school. She and the attendant chat as he gases up their car and cleans the windows. Then they all say good-bye.  As Bill pulls the car onto the road, he turns to Hillary and says, 'Now aren't you glad you married me and not him ? You could've been the wife of a grease monkey !'

Several years later the company contacted  him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with  one of their multi-million dollar machines. They had tried everything and  everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail.  In  desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so  many of their problems in the past. The engineer reluctantly took the challenge.  He spent a day studying  the huge machine.  At the end of the day, he marked a small \"x\" in  chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated,  \"This is where your problem is\". The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The  company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his  service.They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The  engineer responded briefly: One chalk mark                       $1  Knowing where to put it            $49,999 It was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.                                                                                                   6.84\n",

She lives a block away and her name is Susan.\" After dinner, William's dad took him aside. \"Son, I have to talk with you. Your mother and I have been married 30 years.. She's a wonderful wife but she has never offered much excitement in the bedroom, so I used to fool around with women a lot. Susan is actually your half-sister, and I'm afraid you can't marry her.\" William was heart-broken. After eight months he eventually started dating girls again. A year later he came home and very proudly announced, \"Dianne said yes! We're getting married in June.\" Again his father insisted on another private conversation and broke the sad news. \"Dianne is your half-sister too, William. I'm awfully sorry about this.\" William was furious! He finally decided to go to his mother with the news. \"Dad has done so much harm.. I guess I'm never going to get married,\"  he complained. \"Every time I fall in love, Dad tells me the girl is my half-sister.\" His mother just shook her head. \"Don't pay any attention to what he says, dear. He's not really your father.\"    1.55\n",
       "   The Pope dies and, naturally, goes to heaven. He's met by the reception committee, and after a whirlwind tour he is told that he can enjoy any of the myriad of recreations available. He decides that he wants to read all of the ancient original text of the Holy Scriptures, so he spends the next eon or so learning languages. After becoming a linguistic master, he sits down in the library and begins to pour over every version of the Bible, working back from most recent \"Easy Reading\" to the original script. All of a sudden there is a scream in the library. The Angels come running in only to find the Pope huddled in his chair, crying to himself and muttering, \"An 'R'! The scribes left out the 'R'.\"  A particularly concerned Angel takes him aside, offering comfort, asks him what the problem is and what does he mean.  After collecting his wits, the Pope sobs again, \"It's the letter 'R'. They left out the 'R'.
